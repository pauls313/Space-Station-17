# Space-Station-17
This is a Lua/Love2D port of the BYOND game Space Station 13. Feel free to contribute

It's still very early in the project, so we need a lot of things. Listed here in priority:
###1 - Render size fix. In some screens it's too big, in others too small
###2 - UI and inventories to store the items
###3 - View system
